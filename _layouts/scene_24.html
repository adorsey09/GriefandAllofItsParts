You laugh to yourself and think that you are losing your mind and having a hallucination.You decide to get an actual therapist, and your therapist tells you that this may be a manifestation of your own grief. You try to believe her, but you keep seeing the man.</br>
    <br>Finally, you can’t take it anymore, so you decide to have a conversation with him.You decide to talk more with your dad. As you talk with him, you realize that your dad has memories that are similar to yours, but something in the scenario is always off. His memory is somehow accurate, but also not. </br>
    <br>You find out that he is in town for a ‘business meeting’, but has no memory of what his job is. You have more questions for me, but he gets a call.</br>
    <br><i>“I have to go.”</i></br>
    <br>He tells you frantically looking around.</br>
    <br><i>“What do you mean?”</i></br>
    <br><i>“I’ll be back. Just trust me.”</i></br>
    <br>He leaves you in the coffee shop.</br>
